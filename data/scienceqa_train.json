How can the writer best improve his or her academic voice?\nCloning has come a long way since a sheep named Dolly was successfully cloned in 1996. Now it is becoming possible to use cloning for a variety of purposes. For example, cloning technology could be used to grow stem cells from which replacement organs, such as hearts and livers, could be grown.

Scientists, bioethicists, and governments are all exploring this, even though it is clearly unnatural and unethical.",
