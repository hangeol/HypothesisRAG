      "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",

This is a violation of ethical principles and potentially legal requirements. The resident has a duty to report the error, even if it seems minor. The attending's instruction to omit the error from the operative report is unethical and potentially illegal. The resident should not be pressured into concealing the error. The resident should report the error to the appropriate authority, which could be the attending, the hospital ethics committee, or a regulatory body. The resident should not refuse to dictate the operative report, as that would be a direct violation of the attending's instructions and potentially a cover-up of a medical error. The resident should disclose the error to the patient, as the patient has a right to know about any complications or errors that occurred during their surgery. The resident should put the error in the operative report, as this is the standard procedure for documenting surgical events.

Moreover, the proceedings of the M&M con-ference are protected from disclosure by the privilege of \u201cpeer review,\u201d and the details are thus rarely shared with patients or those outside the department.A report from the United States Institute of Medicine titled \u201cTo Err Is Human\u201d highlighted the large number of medi-cal errors that\nDocument [12] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) 44-3).

Dur-ing the ascension of the competence curve, other learners in the institution (i.e., surgical residents) may not have the opportunity to participate in the first case series. Although this may be dif-ficult for them, the best interest of the patient must be put before the education of the resident.The second stage of learning occurs when the new pro-cedure has proven its value and a handful of experts exist, but the majority of surgeons have not been trained to perform the new procedure. In this setting, it is relatively unethical for sur-geons to forge ahead with a new procedure in humans as if they had spent the same amount of time in intensive study that the first team did. The fact that one or several surgical teams were able to perform an operation does not ensure that all others with the same medical degrees can perform the operation with equal skill.

In fact, communication and practice pattern violations were the most common deficiency in care for one third of patients in the Closed Claims Study who received the expected standard of surgical care.54The Importance of Communication in Managing RiskThe manner and tone in which a physician communicates is potentially more important to avoiding a malpractice claim than the actual content of the dialogue. For example, a physician relating to a patient in a \u201cnegative\u201d manner may trigger litigious feelings when there is a bad result, whereas a physician relating in a \u201cpositive\u201d manner may not. Expressions of dominance, in which the voice tone is deep, loud, moderately fast, unaccented, and clearly articulated, may communicate a lack of empathy and understanding for the patient, whereas concern or anxiety in the surgeon\u2019s voice is often positively related to expressing concern and empathy.

The best clinical processes have the potential to break down when there is a toxic work environment and lack of psy-chological safety within the team.The Importance of Diversity and LeadershipThe past quarter century has seen a steady increase in diversity within the field of surgery. Women, as of 2015, represent 38% of surgical trainees and 10% of academic professors currently, but have doubled their representation in the past 20 years.71 Some fields, such as head and neck surgery and plastic surgery72 have studied their own subspecialty groups with similar find-ings. African Americans comprise both 6% of medical school graduates, 6% surgical trainees, and 2% to 4% of professors of surgery nationwide.73 Hispanics represent 5% of graduat-ing medical students, 9% of general surgery trainees, and 4% to 5% of persons at all levels of academic surgery.73 Physician diversity is crucial and may help to address disparities in social determinants of\nDocument [16] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) routine operations, previous suggestions to limit the per-formance of high-complexity operations using selective refer-ral, regionalization, or limitation of privileging may not actually be effective in reducing the incidence of technical error among surgical patients.53In any event, although there has been much emphasis on reducing the prevalence of surgical technical errors as a way of improving surgical care, a technical error in the OR may not be the most important indicator of whether a surgeon will be sued by a patient. Recent studies point to the importance of a surgeon\u2019s communication skills in averting malprac-tice litigation. In the American College of Surgeons\u2019 Closed Claims Study, although intraoperative organ injuries occurred in 40% of patients, a surgical technical misadventure was the most deficient component of care in only 12% of patients.

The patient is evaluated by inspection, palpation, and provocative testing.On inspection, one should first note the position of the hand. The resting hand has a normal cascade of the fingers, with the small finger flexed most and the index finger least (Fig. 44-6). Disturbance of this suggests a tendon or skeletal problem.

Interestingly, the number of sentinel events reported to The Joint Commission has not changed significantly since the wide-spread implementation of the Universal Protocol in 2004.47 This could be due to an increase in reporting rather than an actual increase in the incidence of wrong-site surgery.The legal treatment of wrong-site surgery is similar to that of surgical items erroneously left in a patient: the mere fact that it occurred indicates that the patient did not receive proper surgical care. A malpractice claim may lead to a settlement or award on verdict in the sixor seven-figure range in 2011 U.S. dollars.41Ultimately, the occurrence of retained surgical items or wrong-site surgery is a reflection of the quality of professional communication between caregivers and the degree of teamwork among the members of the operating team.

These organiza-tions also strongly endorse the completion of a postoperative debriefing after every operation. An X-ray at the completion of an operation is encouraged if there is any concern for a foreign body based on confusion regarding the counts by even a single member of the OR team or in the presence of a risk factor.Surgical CountsThe benefit of performing surgical counts to prevent the occur-rence of retained surgical items is controversial. The increased risk of a retained surgical item during emergency surgery in the study by Gawande and colleagues appeared to be related to bypassing the surgical count in many of these cases.44 However, in another study, the \u201cfalsely correct count,\u201d in which a count is performed and declared correct when it is actually incorrect, occurred in 21% to 100% of cases in which a retained surgical item was found.45 This type of count was the most common circumstance encountered in all retained surgical item cases,\nDocument [21] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) more closely after surgery, transplant sur-geons were required to make postoperative visits to both organ donor and recipient, and each registered nurse was assigned to four patients, rather than six or seven.

Of these, mortality was reported in 6.6%, permanent injury in 33%, and temporary injury in 59%. The cost of the never events totaled $1.3 billion.

This is referred to at the tenodesis maneuver.Flexor tendon injuries are described based on zones (Fig. 44-13). Up until 40 years ago, zone 2 injuries were always reconstructed and never repaired primarily due to concern that the bulk of repair within the flexor sheath would prevent tendon glide. The work of Dr. Kleinert and colleagues at the University of Lou-isville changed this \u201caxiom\u201d and established the principle of pri-mary repair and early controlled mobilization postoperatively.17 Flexor tendon\nDocument [24] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) and has proved feasible in several journals, including The Lancet.78As research becomes increasingly interdisciplinary with ever-expanding teams of contributors, it can be difficult to determine which contributions warrant full authorship rather than simple acknowledgement.

By tradition, it has consisted of a regulated apprenticeship system with incremental increases in clinical responsibility for resident surgeons over a specified period of time culminating with the expectation that independent surgical practice will be possible at its conclu-sion. While this approach has served well throughout the 20th century, the pace of changes in healthcare delivery and society itself has driven the need for new approaches to education and training. Among the important changes that the surgical training community has had to confront are an expanding array of medi-cal and surgical therapies, complex, new and sometimes disrup-tive technologies advancing at a dizzying pace, and increasing recognition of the opportunities for errors and adverse outcomes because of inadequate preparation\nDocument [28] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) This is predicated on the concept that \u201cexpert\u201d performance is fun-damentally different than normal performance and results from behaviors that \u201creflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.\u201d16 The drive to achieve mastery in surgery, provides an aspirational model for the surgeon\u2019s use of simulation because the opportunity for deliberate, repetitive practice of numerous skills in the clinical setting alone is insufficient and in many cases nearly impossi-ble. For this concept to be translated into effective educational results, simulation-based education must be of high quality, and the curricular framework created for its use must be directed toward carefully crafted, attainable, and clinically relevant edu-cational goals.Simulation in Graduate Medical EducationSurgery residency has been a particular area of focus for simula-tion use in assessment and training. The need for safe and rapid skills development is especially important in\nDocument [29] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) deformity. There is weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles, similar to that seen with ulnar nerve injury.Radial Nerve The radial nerve courses through the axilla, then laterally and posteriorly in the spiral groove of the humerus. Improper crutch use can cause damage to the axillary portion. The section of the nerve traversing the spiral groove can be damaged by humerus fractures or pressure from improper posi-tioning during sleep. This classically occurs when the patient is intoxicated and is called \u201cSaturday night palsy.\u201d The key find-ing is wrist drop (i.e., weakness of hand and finger extensors). Axillary (proximal) injury causes triceps weakness in addition to wrist drop.Common Peroneal Neuropathy The common peroneal nerve forms the lateral half of the sciatic nerve (the medial half being the tibial nerve).

      "raw_answer": "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the question and the reasoning for the answer: 1. **Identify the Patient's Condition:** The patient has a history of bladder cancer and is undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. He is experiencing sensorineural hearing loss. 2. **Consider the Chemotherapy Regimen:** The question implies that the chemotherapy regimen is likely cisplatin-based, given the patient's age and the fact that cisplatin is a common treatment for bladder cancer. 3. **Recall the Mechanism of Action of Cisplatin:** Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug. Its primary mechanism of action involves the formation of DNA adducts, leading to DNA damage and cell death. 4. **Relate the Mechanism of Action to the Symptom:** The sensorineural hearing loss is likely due to ototoxicity, a known side effect of cisplatin. Ototoxicity results from the drug's interaction with DNA and RNA, leading to damage to the hair cells in the inner ear. 5. **Evaluate the Answer Choices:** * A. Inhibition of proteasome: This is the mechanism of action of proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib, which are used in multiple myeloma and lymphoma, not typically cisplatin. * B. Hyperstabilization of microtubules: This is the mechanism of action of taxanes like paclitaxel, which are used in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer, not typically cisplatin. * C. Generation of free radicals: While some chemotherapy drugs generate free radicals, this is not the primary mechanism of cisplatin. * D. Cross-linking of DNA: This is the primary mechanism of action of cisplatin. Cisplatin forms DNA adducts, leading to DNA damage and cell death. 6. **Conclusion:** The most likely mechanism of action of cisplatin, given the patient's symptoms, is the cross-linking of DNA. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for bladder cancer and is experiencing sensorineural hearing loss, likely due to cisplatin.

There are a wide variety of agents available to treat cancer, and they are usually used in combinations. This results in the fact that every patient is almost unique (an experiment of one) in the combination of agents, doses, durations, and gestational ages of administration, making it very difficult to attribute what benefit or toxicity accrues to which agent. Fortunately, cancer in pregnant women is sufficiently rare that it takes quite a while to accumulate enough information for any one agent or combination of agents to be confident about what toxicities (including congenital malformations) are truly associated with which agents. There is such rapid progress in cancer chemotherapy that by the time there may seem to be enough information about the agents currently in use to use them intelligently and counsel patients meaningfully, the cancer community has moved on to newer, more efficacious, and\nDocument [9] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) Conductive hearing losses may be prevented by prompt antibiotic therapy of adequate duration for AOM and by ventilation of the middle ear with tympanostomy tubes in middle ear effusions lasting \u226512 weeks.

In their review, Lockwood and colleagues suggest that all patients with undifferentiated tinnitus be protected from loud sounds and ototoxic drugs (the main ones being aminoglycoside antibiotics, certain loop diuretics, neurotoxic chemotherapies such as cisplatin, and perhaps high doses of aspirin). The American Tinnitus Association website may be helpful to some patients as a source of reassurance (http://www.ata.org).

For patients with encapsulated tumors and stage I disease, complete resection is sufficient to cure 96% of patients. For patients with stage II disease, complete resection may be followed by 30\u201360 Gy of postoperative radiation therapy to the site of the primary tumor. However, the value of radiation therapy in this setting has not been established. The main predictors of long-term survival are Masaoka stage and completeness of resection. For patients with stage III and IV disease, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery, with or without additional radiation therapy, and additional consolidation chemotherapy has been associated with excellent survival.

However, the survival benefit was seemingly confined to cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (hazard ratio 0.73; 27% reduction in the risk of death; 10% improvement in survival at 1 year). These data launched two decades of clinical research aimed at detecting the optimal chemotherapy regimen for advanced NSCLC. For the most part, however, these efforts proved unsuccessful because the overwhelming majority of randomized trials showed no major survival improvement with any one regimen versus another (Table 107-11). On the other hand, differences in progression-free survival, cost, side effects, and schedule were frequently observed.

Induction Chemotherapy In this strategy, patients receive chemotherapy (current standard is a three-drug regimen of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil [5-FU]) before surgery and radiation therapy. Most patients who receive three cycles show tumor reduction, and the response is clinically \u201ccomplete\u201d in up to half of patients. This \u201csequential\u201d multimodality therapy allows for organ preservation (omission of surgery) in patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer, and it has been shown to result in higher cure rates compared with radiotherapy alone.\nDocument [15] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) Chemotherapy (described below) has been shown to prolong the survival of patients with muscle-invasive disease when combined with definitive treatment of the bladder by radical cystectomy or radiation therapy. Presurgical (or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy has been the most thoroughly explored, and increases the cure rate by 5\u201315%, whereas postsurgical (adjuvant) chemotherapy has not been proven definitively beneficial. For the majority of patients, chemotherapy alone is inadequate to eradicate the disease. Use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is increasing, although it still remains underused. Experimental studies are evaluating bladder preservation strategies by combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy in patients whose tumors were endoscopically removed.\nDocument [16] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) Systemic Chemotherapy A large number of controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies have been performed with most of the major classes of cancer chemotherapy.

Renal toxicity, usually manifested as nonoliguric renal failure, is less common with streptomycin than with other frequently used aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin. Manifestations of vestibular toxicity include loss of balance, vertigo, and tinnitus. Patients receiving streptomycin must be monitored carefully for these adverse effects, undergoing audiometry at baseline and monthly thereafter.\nDocument [20] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) resonance imaging (MRI) should be obtained to exclude retrocochlear pathology such as a cerebellopontine angle tumor or demyelinating disorder. Therapy is directed toward the control of vertigo. A 2-g/d low-salt diet is the mainstay of treatment for control of rotatory vertigo. Diuretics, a short course of glucocorticoids, and intratympanic gentamicin may also be useful adjuncts in recalcitrant cases. Surgical therapy of vertigo is reserved for unresponsive cases and includes endolymphatic sac decompression, labyrinthectomy, and vestibular nerve section. Both labyrinthectomy and vestibular nerve section abolish rotatory vertigo in >90% of cases. Unfortunately, there is no effective therapy for hearing loss, tinnitus, or aural fullness from M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease.\nDocument [21] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) as follows: 2-h infusion of LV (400 mg/m2 per day) followed by a 5-FU bolus (400 mg/m2 per day) and 22-h infusion (1200 mg/m2) every 2 weeks, together with oxaliplatin, 85 mg/m2 as a 2-h infusion on day 1. Oxaliplatin frequently causes a dose-dependent sensory neuropathy that often but not always resolves following the cessation of therapy. FOLFIRI and FOLFOX are equal in efficacy. In metastatic disease, these regimens may produce median survivals of 2 years.\nDocument [22] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) Chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with SCLC. Four to six cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy with either cisplatin or carboplatin plus either etoposide or irinotecan has been the mainstay of treatment for nearly three decades and is recommended over other chemotherapy regimens irrespective of initial stage. Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and vincristine (CAV) may be an alternative for patients who are unable to tolerate a platinum-based regimen. Despite response rates to first-line therapy as high as 80%, the median survival ranges from 12 to 20 months for patients with LD and from 7 to 11 months for patients with ED. Regardless of disease extent, the majority of patients relapse and develop chemotherapy-resistant disease. Only 6\u201312% of patients with LD-SCLC and 2% of patients with ED-SCLC live beyond 5 years. The prognosis is especially poor for patients who relapse within the first 3 months of therapy; these patients are said to have\nDocument [23] (Title: First_Aid_Step2) Dx: Diagnosis is made clinically and is based on a thorough history and physical exam. Two episodes (lasting 20 minutes or more) with remission of symptoms between episodes, hearing loss documented at least once with audiometry, and tinnitus or aural fullness are needed to make the diagnosis once other causes (e.g., TIA, otosyphilis) have been ruled out. A brain MRI with vascular imaging (e.g., MRA) may help assess potential intracranial pathology, particularly cerebrovascular disease. \u25a0 Tx: Classically, a low-sodium diet and diuretic therapy were first-line treatments. As theories of pathogenesis have shifted, many clinicians have begun to treat patients with \u201cmigraine\u201d diets, other lifestyle changes, prophylactic antimigraine medications, and occasionally benzodiazepines or antiemetics. For severe unilateral cases, ablative therapies (e.g., intratympanic gentamicin to damage the labyrinth, vestibular nerve section) have been used with some success.\nDocument [24] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) in progression-free survival, cost, side effects, and schedule were frequently observed. These first-line studies were later extended to elderly patients, where doublet chemotherapy was found to improve overall survival compared to single agents in the \u201cfit\u201d elderly (e.g., elderly patients with no major comorbidities) and in patients with an ECOG performance status of 2. An ongoing debate in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC is the appropriate duration of platinum-based chemotherapy. Several large phase III randomized trials have failed to show a meaningful benefit for increasing the duration of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy beyond four to six cycles. In fact, longer duration of chemotherapy has been associated with increased toxicities and impaired quality of life. Therefore, prolonged front-line therapy (beyond four to six cycles) with platinum-based regimens is not recommended. Maintenance therapy following initial platinum-based therapy is discussed below.\nDocument [25] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) Patients with radiographs and physical examination showing no evidence of disease and serum AFP and hCG concentrations that are either normal or declining to normal according to the known half-life have clinical stage I disease. Approximately 20\u201350% of such patients will have retroperitoneal lymph node metastases (pathologic stage II) but will still be cured in over 95% of cases. Depending on risk of relapse, which is determined by the pathology (see below), surveillance, a nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), or adjuvant chemotherapy (one to two cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin [BEP]) may be appropriate choices depending on the availability of surgical expertise and patient and physician preference. If the primary tumor shows no evidence for lymphatic or vascular invasion and is limited to the testis (T1, clinical stage IA), then the risk of relapse is only 10\u201320%. Because over 80% of patients with clinical stage IA nonseminoma are cured with\nDocument [26] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) nodes involved, or any involved node >2 cm in largest diameter, or extranodal tumor extension), two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered, as it results in a cure in \u226598% of patients. Regimens consisting of etoposide plus cisplatin (EP) with or without bleomycin every 3 weeks are effective and well tolerated.\nDocument [27] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) Sensorineural Hearing Loss Sensorineural hearing loss results from either damage to the mechanotransduction apparatus of the cochlea or disruption of the electrical conduction pathway from the inner ear to the brain. Thus, injury to hair cells, supporting cells, auditory neurons, or the central auditory pathway can cause sensorineural hearing loss. Damage to the hair cells of the organ of Corti may be caused by intense noise, viral infections, ototoxic drugs (e.g., salicylates, quinine and its synthetic analogues, aminoglycoside antibiotics, loop diuretics such as furosemide and ethacrynic acid, and cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin), fractures of the temporal bone, meningitis, cochlear otosclerosis (see above), M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease, and aging. Congenital malformations of the inner ear may be the cause of hearing loss in some adults. Genetic predisposition alone or in concert with environmental exposures may also be responsible (see below).\nDocument [28] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) FIguRE 28-1 Modified Epley maneuver for treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the right (top panels) and left (bottom panels) posterior semicircular canals. Step 1. With the patient seated, turn the head 45 degrees toward the affected ear. Step 2. Keeping the head turned, lower the patient to the head-hanging position and hold for at least 30 s and until nystagmus disappears. Step 3. Without lifting the head, turn it 90 degrees toward the other side. Hold for another 30 s. Step 4. Rotate the patient onto her side while turning the head another 90 degrees, so that the nose is pointed down 45 degrees. Hold again for 30 s. Step 5. Have the patient sit up on the side of the table. After a brief rest, the maneuver should be repeated to confirm successful treatment. (Figure adapted from http://www.dizziness-and-balance.com/ disorders/bppv/movies/Epley-480x640.avi.) gentamicin or other aminoglycoside antibiotics). Other causes include bilateral vestibular schwannomas\nDocument [29] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) The toxicity of four cycles of the BEP is substantial. Nausea, vomiting, and hair loss occur in most patients, although nausea and vomiting have been markedly ameliorated by modern antiemetic regimens. Myelosuppression is frequent, and symptomatic bleomycin pulmonary toxicity occurs in ~5% of patients. Treatment-induced mortality due to neutropenia with septicemia or bleomycin-induced pulmonary failure occurs in 1\u20133% of patients. Dose reductions for myelosuppression are rarely indicated. Long-term permanent toxicities include nephrotoxicity (reduced glomerular filtration and persistent magnesium wasting), ototoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and infertility. When bleomycin is administered by weekly bolus injection, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon appears in 5\u201310% of patients. Other evidence of small blood vessel damage, such as transient ischemic attacks and myocardial infarction, is seen less often.\nDocument [30] (Title: First_Aid_Step2) Other urinary symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, and dysuria, may also be seen, but most patients are asymptomatic in the early stages of disease. Cystoscopy with biopsy is diagnostic. UA often shows hematuria (macroor microscopic); cytology may show dysplastic cells. IVP can examine the upper urinary tract as well as defects in bladder filling. \u25a0MRI, CT, and bone scan are important tools with which to define invasion and metastases. Treatment depends on the extent of spread beyond the bladder mucosa. Carcinoma in situ: Intravesicular chemotherapy. Superf cial cancers: Complete transurethral resection or intravesicular chemotherapy with mitomycin-C or BCG (the TB vaccine). Large, high-grade recurrent lesions: Intravesicular chemotherapy. Invasive cancers without metastases: Radical cystectomy or radiotherapy for patients who are deemed poor candidates for radical cystectomy as well as for those with unresectable local disease.\nDocument [31] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) The first goal of therapy is to eradicate or control the malignancy. Late treatment consequences are, indeed, testimony to the increasing success of such treatment. Their occurrence sharply underlines the necessity to develop more effective therapies with less long-term morbidity and mortality. At the same time, a sense of perspective and relative risk is necessary; fear of long-term complications should not prevent the application of effective, particularly curative, cancer treatment.\n\nHere is the question:\nA 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear.
